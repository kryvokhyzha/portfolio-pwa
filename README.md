# portfolio-pwa

## About
This is progressive web application with my CV.

## Attention
+   This project deployed on cloud PaaS-platform called **Heroku**
+   When an app on Heroku doesn't receive any traffic in **1 hour**, the application goes to **sleep**
+   This causes a **short delay for this first request**, but subsequent requests will perform **normally**

## Cache
+   Also, progressive web application can **automatically update**
+   Press **_CTRL+Shift+R_** to do **force page** reload with cache update
